                Publish-Subscribe Pattern
!    -Used to communicate messages between different system components
  WITHOUT them KNOWING anything about each other's identitty
    -Senders(publishers)DON'T program the messages to be SENT DIRECTLY to SPECIFIC RECEIVERS(subscribers)
    -Subscribers express interest in One or More Events, and ONLY RECEIVE  messages that are of interest
    -An intermediary (called a "message broker" or "event bus")
        -Receives published messages
        -Forwards them to the subscribers who are registered to receive them
        -Scheme of messages looks like this

            Publisher ->                                   -> Subscribers
            Publisher ->   ->->->  [EVENT BUS]  ->->->     -> Subscribers
            Publisher ->                                   -> Subscribers
        
        
        Advantages:
        -Decouple and Scale Independently
            -Makes software more flexible
        -Eliminate Polling
            -Promotes faster response time and reduces the delivery latency
        -Simplify Communication
            -Reduces complexity by removing all the point-to-point connectionss with a single connection

            //! Events are NOT ASYNCHRONOUS!


                    Streams
        -Collections of data that is not available at once
            -Data may come continously in chunks
        -Types:
            -Readable - can only be read(process.stdin)
            -Writeable - can only be written on (process.stdout)
            -Dublex - both Readable and Writeable (TCP sockets/communication)
            -Transform - the output is computed from the intput(zlib,crypto)
        
                    Readable Streams
        -Functions:
            -read() - get chunks from the stream 
            -pause() - switch to paused mode 
            -resume() - switc to flowing mode 
        -Events - used when the stream is flowing
            -data - chunk is available for reading
            -end - no more data
            -error - an exception has occurred
                    Writable Streams
        -Functions:
            -write() - send chunks to the stream
            -end() - close the stream
        -Events 
            -drain - stream can receive more data
            -finish - all data has been flushed ( buffer is empty)
            -error - an exception has occurred
